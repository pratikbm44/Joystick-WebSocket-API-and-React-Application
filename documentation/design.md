React Application Design

Overview

The React application is a real-time joystick interface that allows users to interact with a joystick component and send joystick data to the WebSocket API server. The application uses Socket.IO to establish a WebSocket connection with the server, enabling real-time bidirectional communication.


Components

The React application consists of the following components:

    App: The main component that renders the joystick component and displays received joystick data.

    JoystickComponent: This component represents the joystick interface that users can interact with. It captures joystick movements and sends the data to the WebSocket API.


State Management

The React application uses React hooks to manage the state:

    socket: A state variable that holds the WebSocket connection object. It is initially set to null and gets updated after successful login with a valid JWT token.

    receivedData: A state variable that stores an array of received joystick data. It gets updated when the server broadcasts joystick data to all connected clients.


User Authentication

The application supports user authentication with the WebSocket API server:

    handleLogin: This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Login" button. It sends a POST request to the /api/login endpoint with the user's credentials (username and password). If the login is successful, the server responds with a JWT token, which is stored in the browser's local storage.

    socket: The WebSocket connection is established with the server using the JWT token obtained after successful login. The token is sent as an authentication argument to the server, allowing the server to authenticate the user before establishing the WebSocket connection.


WebSocket Connection

The React application establishes a WebSocket connection with the server to enable real-time communication:

    useEffect: The useEffect hook is used to connect to the WebSocket API server when the application mounts. It checks if a valid JWT token is present in the local storage. If the token exists, it establishes a WebSocket connection using Socket.IO and updates the socket state variable with the connection object.

    handleMouseMove: This function is called when the user interacts with the joystick. It calculates the joystick position based on mouse or touch movement and sends the joystick data to the WebSocket server using the socket.emit method with the joystickData event.

    socket.on: The application listens for incoming joystickData events from the WebSocket server. When data is received, it is added to the receivedData state, and the UI is updated accordingly.


Conclusion

The React application provides users with a real-time joystick interface, allowing them to interact with the joystick and send data to the WebSocket API server. The application handles user authentication to ensure secure communication with the server. The use of React hooks and state management enables efficient handling of WebSocket connections and data updates.
